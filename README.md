# OpenClicker
A open source auto clicker for games

## Features
- random wait time between clicks
- random mouse movement (alpha)
- key binding

## How to use it
- Go to the Debug folder (bin > Debug)
- Put the shortcut anywhere on your computer and click on it
- Once OpenClicker is opened, set the min time and the max time (I recommend 100 for the min time and 150 for the max time)
- By default, the start key is "Insert" and the end key is "Delete" but you can change it by clicking the "Set" buttons
- When you are ready, press the start key that you chose and press the end key to stop
- Final step : Enjoy that free XP :)
